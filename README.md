# Desert-Rush
My entry to the Ludum Dare 39 competition 
The them was "Running out of power"

# Description
Your goal in this top-down shooter is to escort your buggy along the desert road, to the side of which a raiders’ camp is set.

Buggy’s fuel is depleted, so you need to replenish it by small portions that you can find on the map, but be swift, as raiders won’t give you much time for search!

# Features
+ 2 different weapons for player that can be changed in the battle to use the circumstances to your advantage:
  1. Laser auto-rifle - fast rate of fire, easy to hit, low DMG
  2. Plasma - 1 projctile, slow rate of fire, hard to hit, oneshot
+ Core mechanic - you need to escort a vehicle to the point, attacks are periodical, and you need to leave it to find fuel to progress further
+ 2 types of enemies with different, albeit rather plain behaviours. 
+ Vehicle shield mechanic
+ Desert map with an old, broken road
+ Bluesy soundtrack
